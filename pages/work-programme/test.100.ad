This document serves both as the 2020 revision of the <<_gbif_implementation_plan_2017_2021>> and also as the GBIF Annual Work Programme 2020. Both elements are based upon the https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan[GBIF Strategic Plan 2017–2021].

The relationship between these documents is represented by the following graphic.

The https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan[Strategic Plan] (agreed in 2015 at GB22) established five priorities for GBIF’s work.

The Implementation Plan presented here in this document identifies 22 activities which GBIF must undertake to address these priorities during the five-year period (and a set of specific tasks under each activity).
